# Agola Go example

This is just a simple example to test a agola run that'll build a simple go program using a matrix build (using multiple Go versions and optionally multiple architectures)

It uses the jsonnet config format

There's also a (less powerful) yaml config file (to try it delete the jsonnet config since it takes precedence)
